                    <section class="tip">Buy algae pads at a pet shop instead of the housewares department of a regular
                        store. Although they may look the same, the housewares pads can have soap or chemical residue.
                        That residue doesn't matter if you are cleaning your kitchen sink, but it can be lethal to your
                        fish.<br>For stubborn residue on the glass, use a razor blade to scrape it off. Take care not to
                        cut yourself. If your aquarium is acrylic, use a plastic razor blade, as standard razors will
                        scratch the acrylic.</section>
                    <section class="tip">In Ronald Shimek's Aquarium Frontier's online magazine article "What are
                        Natural Reef Salinities and Temperatures...Really...and Does It Matter?" he makes the point that
                        the corals you have in your tank come from many different ocean water temperatures ranging from
                        72 degrees up to about 92 degrees. He states that "Maintaining a tank in the upper 70 degrees
                        Fahrenheit (24 to 26 degrees Celsius) range will stress any reef inhabitants from the central
                        Indo-Pacific, as it is too cold. And, because this is near the upper limits for subtropical
                        organisms, it will stress them as well. It would be better for all concerned if aquarists
                        concentrated their efforts on maintaining separate systems for organisms from geographically
                        disparate areas." Knowing what kind of animals you have and from where they come plays an
                        important part in deciding what is the best tank temperature for your Saltwater aquarium.</section>
                    <section class="tip">1. When choosing your dive school, check to see if you’ll be diving in warm or
                        cold water, what sea life the area is known for, and how much the accreditation costs. Getting
                        your open water certificate takes three full days of training or longer, so you’ll want to be
                        somewhere both comfortable and memorable.<br>2. Safety should be your number one concern when choosing a dive school. Before you go, check
                        out online reviews to see if other divers write about consistent issues like disorganization,
                        missed safety briefings, or faulty equipment. A safe dive school maintains a low student to
                        instructor ratio, never leaves equipment on the floor, and communicates clearly with its
                        students.<br>

                        3. To maximize your confidence and comfort underwater, practice swimming and yoga for a few
                        months leading up to your dive course. Yoga helps you learn to focus on your breathing, one of
                        the most important elements of scuba diving. Swimming helps you maintain control of your body
                        underwater.<br>

                        4. Learn about different scuba diving agencies to find out which one is best for you. The two
                        biggest are PADI and SSI. Here’s a pro and con resource from Scuba World on PADI vs. SSI.<br></section>
                    <section class="tip">When harvesting fish, you have to decompress them before fish can be surfaced to the top of the water, if they are collected from deep water. Therefore, if you do not properly decompress a fish can result in death or permanent injury. Properly decompressing a fish is simple, it just takes patience.  Much of the information provided here pertains to how to put fish into the catch bucket without it escaping or getting damaged.</section>
